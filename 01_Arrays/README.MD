## 💡 Approach

- For **Second Largest Element**, I iterated through the array and kept track of the largest and second-largest elements using comparison.
- For **Rotate An Array By K**, I first solved it with a brute-force approach and then optimized it to an in-place algorithm to minimize space complexity.
